# Fuel_Economy_By_Ethanol_Perc
A tidy and analysis of a fuel economy data set

## Introduction:
Sources: The original source for this analysis was a collection of 24 CSVs containing over 700 rows of data and 19 columns.

Goal: The goal of this project was to import the files, tidy the data for analysis, decide on a model to determine the significance of any differences, and draw conclusions about ethanol combustion and fuel economy. 

About: Data was collected from a single Toyota Seneca over the course of the experiment. Data is messy, and causal relationships are impossible to determine from a myriad of difficulties present in the data. This project is more of a proof of concept on tidying and modeling rather than an analysis of statistical significance. These issues are addressed in the HTML.

## Files Included:
- A finished HTML file with the introduction, background, and analysis of the project. Included are any supplementary graphs.

- **Within src folder:**
  - A QMD file used to produce the above HTML.
  - An R file including all code used to produce the HTML final product and Metadata.
  - The original CSVs in the data folder.
